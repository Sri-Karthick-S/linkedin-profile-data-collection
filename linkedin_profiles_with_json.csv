Rules give space to creativity. In the same way that theoretical math and sourdough fermentation became cozy houses, I am finding that software engineering is a place of challenge and rest.\n\nIf you'd like to be in touch, then please email me: raz.joan@gmail.com\nAlso, see my personal portfolio: www.joanrasmussen.dev"", ""location"": {""country"": ""United States"", ""city"": ""Boulder, Colorado"", ""full"": ""Boulder, Colorado, United States"", ""country_code"": ""US""}, ""creator_hashtags"": [], ""is_creator"": false, ""is_influencer"": false, ""is_premium"": false, ""created_timestamp"": 1452364404279, ""show_follower_count"": false, ""background_picture_url"": ""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5616AQF5q1vn3A8kpA/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1627315638579?e=1760572800&v=beta&t=In8MVpeFb5Aa_kNOaltq-KTIL5qPe2-ZaBuwTO-2ubk"", ""urn"": ""ACoAABwqWe8Bzj9q6Dfeqhg2elMQ7MqEuUBKf_s"", ""follower_count"": 309, ""connection_count"": 307, ""current_company"": ""The Trade Desk"", ""current_company_urn"": ""892001"", ""current_company_url"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-trade-desk"", ""email"": ""raz.joan@gmail.com""}, ""experience"": [{""title"": ""Frontend Software Engineer II"", ""company"": ""The Trade Desk"", ""location"": ""Hybrid"", ""duration"": ""Apr 2024 - Present \u00b7 1 yr 6 mos"", ""start_date"": {""year"": 2024, ""month"": ""Apr""}, ""is_current"": true, ""company_linkedin_url"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/company/892001/"", ""company_logo_url"": ""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEiipi1eIta9A/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1712686752136/the_trade_desk_logo?e=1760572800&v=beta&t=uk6snvtk5jr9p7cmbgiw2jkv70vcRAKZnuQXaaJkxYI"", ""employment_type"": ""Full-time"", ""company_id"": ""892001""}, {""title"": ""Software Engineer I"", ""company"": ""The Trade Desk"", ""location"": ""Boulder, Colorado, United States"", ""description"": ""Tech: React, Typescript, C#"", ""duration"": ""Jul 2022 - Apr 2024 \u00b7 1 yr 10 mos"", ""start_date"": {""year"": 2022, ""month"": ""Jul""}, ""end_date"": {""year"": 2024, ""month"": ""Apr""}, ""is_current"": false, ""company_linkedin_url"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/company/892001/"", ""company_logo_url"": ""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEiipi1eIta9A/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1712686752136/the_trade_desk_logo?e=1760572800&v=beta&t=uk6snvtk5jr9p7cmbgiw2jkv70vcRAKZnuQXaaJkxYI"", ""employment_type"": ""Full-time"", ""company_id"": ""892001""}, {""title"": ""Junior Software Engineer"", ""company"": ""SumUp"", ""location"": ""Boulder, Colorado, United States"", ""description"": ""Tech: Next.js, React, Typescript, Ant Design\n- Helped to plan and successfully built a greenfield project.\n- Owned the associated stories end-to-end.\n- Provided full test coverage for the components."", ""duration"": ""Apr 2022 - Jun 2022 \u00b7 3 mos"", ""start_date"": {""year"": 2022, ""month"": ""Apr""}, ""end_date"": {""year"": 2022, ""month"": ""Jun""}, ""is_current"": false, ""company_linkedin_url"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/company/2619512/"", ""company_logo_url"": ""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQFKTfHAXegsGQ/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630531414092/sumup_logo?e=1760572800&v=beta&t=hoqY707a10ZZ108GPQosglbvyjHUc1evLBCbDmx0RXs"", ""company_id"": ""2619512""}, {""title"": ""Student"", ""company"": ""Turing"", ""location"": ""Denver, Colorado, United States"", ""description"": ""An intensive, seven-month certificate program that teaches the fundamentals of web design and development.

If you haven't yet, check out my portfolio site, or my Annie's Analytics company page on here where I offer consulting services.\n\nHeres my story. \n\nIn February of 2022, I decided to learn data analytics for fun. I created a Tik Tok account, and started documenting my journey to learn this new hobby (@anniesanalytics). \n\nVery soon, I realized that every day I was waking up and just wanting to write SQL, build visualizations, learn Python.... Work with data! So, I decided that once I finished graduate school (in Healthcare) in July, I was going to become a data analyst. \n\nAlong the way, I have shared here and on Tik Tok everything I can about what it's like to learn data analytics, and how you can do it for free or at least very cheaply. I've shared about the ups and downs of job searching. I've even shared about how I have built a portfolio, and set myself up as a real analyst. \n\nNow I also do YouTube videos, especially my series where I invite other data analysts to have a coffee chat with me, but we live stream it! We talk about our journeys into data and what our jobs look like now. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3wIL0Blsv2vf8aAjTQXo017YntAXqrZc\n\n\nWant to see my Portfolio as it was when I got my first job in analytics? I left it here in exactly the same state that it was when I got my job in July of 2022 to serve as an example to you, if you are a job seeker now! https://anniesanalytics.wixsite.com/annie-nelson/projects-6 \n\nWant to see my current portfolio I am using now that I have gained some more skills? https://anniesanalytics.carrd.co/\n\nOr the LinkedIn group here: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12635532\n\nDiscord here! https://discord.com/invite/m9vZKtReFM"", ""location"": {""country"": """", ""city"": ""United States"", ""full"": ""United States""}, ""creator_hashtags"": [""sql"", ""python"", ""tableau"", ""breakintotech"", ""dataanalytics""], ""is_creator"": true, ""is_influencer"": true, ""is_premium"": true, ""created_timestamp"": 1644248062958, ""show_follower_count"": true, ""background_picture_url"": ""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E16AQH33lVjCN_nkw/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1684768943026?e=1760572800&v=beta&t=IGUl1CQHuV3Igk0UCGbuHL-ZSD67_CZJt-bWsg3F8TY"", ""urn"": ""ACoAADnZ3YkBy1u7g98kWlGTT_RMLO3VeiqzxdM"", ""follower_count"": 119862, ""connection_count"": 29906, ""current_company"": ""GitLab"", ""current_company_urn"": ""5101804"", ""current_company_url"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/company/gitlab-com"", ""email"": null}, ""experience"": [{""title"": ""Senior Data Analyst"", ""company"": ""GitLab"", ""location"": ""Remote"", ""duration"": ""Jul 2025 -
